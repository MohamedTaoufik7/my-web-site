       Starting with my first internship, I completed my internship at
<strong>General Computer</strong> on July 23, 2023, in Sfax.
	During my internship, I learned how to set up drivers for a variety of devices such as printers, computers, CCTV cameras, and servers, as well as how to diagnose and repair PCs and printers.    </div>

	Moving on to the following year, I completed my internship at TEL’NET on August 1, 2024, in Sfax.
During this internship, I learned how to program TPEs (Electronic Payment Terminals).
My main objective was to develop a complete user interface for the TPE and manage the payment cards it supports, such as VISA and MasterCard. To achieve this, I used programming languages including C and C++.

	For my final-year project, I developed a robot based on STM32 technology designed to follow lines in order to deliver objects to workers. This project was carried out as an internship in collaboration with MASS Group.
I designed a line-based grid to guide the robot, making task execution more efficient. In addition, I developed a web interface that allows users to enter coordinates to control and manage the robot’s movements.       </br>
